# UnitTestingExamples
Some basic unit test for an iOS project using XCTest and OCMock.

OCMock is added via [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). You should install it from [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases). If you want to update OCMock to its newest version simply run the `carthage update` command in your terminal.
